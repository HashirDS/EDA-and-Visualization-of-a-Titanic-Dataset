# 🧪 EDA and Visualization of a Titanic Dataset

Welcome! This project is part of my Data Science & Analytics Internship by **DevelopersHub Corporation**.

In this task, I worked with the famous **Titanic Dataset** and performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to find patterns and insights using Python.

## 🔍 What I Did (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Load the Dataset
I used Pandas to load the Titanic dataset and check the structure of the data.

### 2️⃣ Clean the Data
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values using simple imputation
- Checked for outliers using visual tools like boxplots

### 3️⃣ Create Visuals
I created different types of plots to explore the dataset:

#### 📊 Bar Chart: Survival by Gender
Shows how many males and females survived.

#### 📈 Histogram: Age Distribution
Shows the distribution of passenger ages.

#### 📉 Boxplot: Fare Distribution
Helps visualize outliers in the ticket fare.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- Most passengers were in the 20–40 age range.
- Higher fare passengers generally had a better survival chance.
